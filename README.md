# Information Retrieval Project
## Jose Millan - Rodney Ledesma

The current document presents the solutions for the Laboratories 1, 2 and 4 from the Information Retrieval course, based on the course from the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya with the same name. The three laboratories focus in understanding Zipf'and Heaps' laws, working with tf-idf for documents and calculating the metrics for the Erdös-Rényi and Watts-Strogatz Network Models, respectively.
